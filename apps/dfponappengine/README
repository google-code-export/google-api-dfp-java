Google App Engine for Java meet DFP API, Part 1: Hello World
===========================================================

This is a sample project that shows how to utilize the DFP API on Google App Engine for
Java. For more information view the blog post that explains how the code was built
from scratch at: http://googleadsdeveloper.blogspot.com/


Are there some general troubleshooting tips I can follow if I'm having a problem?
-----------------------------

Try following the steps below:
  - Are you using the latest version of the Google App Engine Plugin?

  - Are you using the latest version of Google App Engine?

  - Clean your project, exit out of Eclipse, open it back up and clean your project again.

  - Can you type "java -version" at the command line without getting an error?

  - When you type "java -version" on the command line does it return a JDK instead of a JRE?

  - If you are receiving an AccessControlException on the CommonWsdl.wsdl file you will need to
chmod +x to allow App Engine to serve the file.
